A Poem in Java
Itâ€™s really a waste of time
Something to do because I can
I can easily print a list of rhymes
fat
sat
bat
hat
cat
Then do it all again
cat
hat
bat
sat
fat
I can make words from other words
to Cry is to have tears
From afar looks so odd and uneven
Yet once compiled is all become clear
None of this really makes much sense
Yet, it was fun to make
